<p><font face="Symbol" size="+1">y</font><font size="+1">(t/2) and
</font><font face="Symbol" size="+1">f</font><font size="+1">(t) are
related by a scaling equation, similar to </font><font size="+1"><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/Multiresolution/ScalingEq.gif" target="_blank">the equation which relates </a></font><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/Multiresolution/ScalingEq.gif" target="_blank"><font face="Symbol" size="+1">j</font><font size="+1">(t/2) and </font><font face="Symbol" size="+1">j</font><font size="+1">(t)</font></a><font size="+1">. It is a consequence of (7.60):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The h and g filters are a </font><font size="+1"><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/filtres/Perfect_Reconstruction.html#filtres_conjugues" target="_blank">conjugate mirror filter bank</a></font><font size="+1">.</font></p>

<h2>Vanishing moments</h2>

<p><font size="+1">A wavelet has m vanishing moments if and only if
its scaling function can generate polynomials of degree smaller than
or equal to m. While this property is used to describe the
approximating power of scaling functions, in the wavelet case it has
a "dual" usage, e.g. the possibility to caracterize the order of
isolated singularities.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The number of vanishing moments is entirely
determined by the coefficients h[n] of the filter h which is featured
in the </font><font size="+1"><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/Multiresolution/ScalingEq.gif" target="_blank">scaling equation.</a></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">If the Fourier transform of the wavelet is p
continuously differentiable, then the three following conditions are
equivalent:</font></p>

<ul>
   <li><font size="+2">the wavelet </font><font face="Symbol" size="+2">y</font><font size="+2"> has p vanishing
   moments</font>
   
   </li><li><font size="+2">the scaling function </font><font face="Symbol" size="+2">j</font><font size="+2"> can generate polynomials of
   degree smaller than or equal to p</font>
   
   </li><li><font size="+2">the transfer function of the filter h and its
   p-1 first derivatives vanish at </font><font face="Symbol" size="+2">w=p.</font>
</li></ul>

<h2>Compact support</h2>

<p><font size="+1">Compactly supported wavelets and scaling functions
exist.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The scaling function is compactly supported if and
only if the filter h has a finite support, and their supports are the
same. If the support of the scaling function is [N</font><sub><font size="+1">1</font></sub><font size="+1">,N</font><sub><font size="+1">2</font></sub><font size="+1">], then the wavelet support
is [(N</font><sub><font size="+1">1</font></sub><font size="+1">-N</font><sub><font size="+1">2</font></sub><font size="+1">+1)/2,(N</font><sub><font size="+1">2</font></sub><font size="+1">-N</font><sub><font size="+1">1</font></sub><font size="+1">+1)2].</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">Atoms are thus compactly supported if and only if
the filter h is.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Daubechies has proved that, to generate an
orthogonal wavelet with p vanishing moment, a filter h with minimum
length 2p had to be used. Daubechies filters, which generate
Daubechies wavelets, have a length of 2p. The Daubechies filter
coefficients are available as </font><font size="+1"><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/Tables/Daubechies/">ASCII text
files</a></font><font size="+1"> which can be used in a spreadsheet,
for instance.</font></p>

<h2>Regularity</h2>

<p><font size="+1">Wavelet regularity is much less important than
their vanishing moments. Il is studied in a </font><font size="+1"><a href="http://cas.ensmp.fr/%7Echaplais/wavetour_presentation/ondelettes/TchamitchianUS.gif" target="_blank">theorem by
Tchamitchian</a></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The following two properties are important:</font>
</p>

<ul>
   <li><font size="+1">there is no compactly supported orthogonal
   wavelet which indefinitely differentiable</font>
   
   </li><li><font size="+1">for Daubechies wavelets with a large p, the
   scaling function and wavelet are l-Lipschitz, where l is of the
   order of 0.2 p. For large classes of orthogonal wavelets, more
   regularity implies more vanishing moments.</font>
</li></ul>

<p><font size="+1">Meyer wavelets are indefinitely differentiable
orthogonal wavelets, with an infinite support. They are generally
implemented in the Fourier domain.</font></p>

<h2>Symmetry</h2>

<p><font size="+1">Symmetric scaling functions and wavelets are
important because they are used to build bases of regular wavelets
over an interval, rather than the real axis. Daubechies has proved
that, for a wavelet to be symmetric or antisymmetric, its filter must
have a linear complex phase, and the only symmetric compactly
supported conjugate mirror filter is the Haar filter, which
corresponds to a discontinuous wavelet with one vanishing moment.
Besides the Haar wavelet, there is </font><b><font size="+1">no
symmetric compactly supported orthogonal wavelet.</font></b></p>
